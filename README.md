# BIG_2021_microbiome_evolution

Repository for code used by the 2021 BIG summer students in the Garud lab. This code builds off of the [microbiome_evolution](https://github.com/benjaminhgood/microbiome_evolution) repo and retains the same license.




For big students:

The code in this repo is primarily written in Python 2.7 and uses the following Python packages: numpy, matplotlib, and scipy. If you do not have Python 2.7 on your local machine we will go over how to manage environments using conda.
